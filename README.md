# Basic Calculator in C++

### *Description:*

a simple command-line calculator application in a programming language of your choice (e.g., C++, C#, Java). The application allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponential and square root) on two or more numbers. 



The application is designed using object-oriented programming principles, encapsulating all functionality within a Calculator class. The class handles expression parsing, validation, evaluation, and history tracking, providing error handling for invalid input, incomplete expressions, division by zero, and unbalanced parentheses.
